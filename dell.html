        <h2>Dell Technologies</h2>
        <p>Dell Technologies is an American multinational technology company that was founded by Michael Dell in 1984. Dell is headquartered in Round Rock, Texas, and is known for its innovations in the PC and enterprise products market. Dell initially operated
            as a direct-to-consumer PC sales company.</p>
        <img class="history-img" src="michael_dell.jpg" alt="Michael Dell">
        <p>The company's strategy was unique because it allowed customers to order PCs directly from Dell, which would then be assembled according to customer specifications. Over the years, Dell expanded into servers, storage devices, networking products,
            and services. Dell became a public company in 1988 and has since grown into one of the world's largest technology companies.</p>
