        <p>Apple's first product, the Apple I, was a hand-built computer sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips) to hobbyists. The Apple II, released in 1977, was one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Apple's
            introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 marked a milestone with its graphical user interface, setting the standard for personal computing.</p>
